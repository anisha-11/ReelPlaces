# ReelPlaces

Have you ever been curious to see where your favourite movies or TV series have been filmed?

ReelPlaces allows you to search for the location you are currently at using a dropdown menu, and shows you the top 12 movies that were filmed there. Those movies then give you further information such as, the release year, plot, stars and IMDb rating. With ReelPlaces, you can get access to a map which pinpoints the nearby filming locations and then you are ready to go and explore them!

## MVP
We began by mind-mapping multiple ideas and potential features, narrowing down our Minimum Viable Product which was being able to search for a location and view the list of movies correlating to that location.

For our MVP, we would like our app to acheive the following user stories:

```
As a user,
So I can search for the location, 
It should have a home page.  
```

```
As a user,
So I can see the movies,
It should be able to show up on the home page.
```
As we completed the above, we started to build our product up feature by feature till we ended up with something we were all proud of.
